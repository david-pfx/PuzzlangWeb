## Puzzlang Web Player

Puzzlang is a pattern language for abstract single-player games and puzzles, plus a Unity player. See [blog](http://www.polyomino.com/puzzlang).

Puzzlang implements a pattern language compatible with PuzzleScript, an incredibly ingenious creation of Stephen Lavelle. 
More on the [blog](http://www.polyomino.com/puzzlescript) or [here](https://www.puzzlescript.net).
Puzzlang has a compiler, a universal games engine and a player targeting Unity. 
This in turn can be used to create players for almost any platform: Windows desktop, Linux, WebGL, Android, iOS and so on.

This is the Web Player, for anyone to use. Just click the [link](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzlangWeb/WebGL) and play Yet Another Sokoban!
